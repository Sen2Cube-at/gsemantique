# global semantic EO data cubes 

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

## Package description
<img src="docs/py_logo.png" align="right" width="150" />

This package builds on top of [semantique](https://zgis.github.io/semantique/#) and extends its functionality by offering:
1. Pre-configured access to a variety of EO datasets with global coverage (e.g. Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Landsat)
2. Retrieval & storage mechanisms for the data to persist data cube inputs locally and simplify the rebuilding of the data cubes and replication of the analyses
3. Scaling mechanisms that allow to evaluate recipes for large spatio-temporal extents up to the mesoscale, with internal automatic handling of the required chunking of the processing into smaller parts
