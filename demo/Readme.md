This directory contains several files demonstrating the usage of gsemantique. The following scripts are contained:

* `basics_data.ipynb` -> explains the fundamentals of addressing data with gsemantique
* `basics_processing.ipynb` -> explains the fundamentals of model creation & execution with gsemantique
* `example_clouds.ipynb` -> showcases how to create cloud-free composites
* `example_forests.ipynb` -> showcases how to create several models for forest disturbance assessments
* `large_scale_clouds.py` -> calculates cloud-free statistics
* `large_scale_clouds.sh` -> wrapper around `large_scale_clouds.py`  

To reproduce the results from our paper, look at the following files:
* Section 5.1 (Application I – cloud-free scenes): `large_scale_clouds.py` & `large_scale_clouds.sh`
* Section 5.2 (Application II – forest disturbances): `example_forests.ipynb`
